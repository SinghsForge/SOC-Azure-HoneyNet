# Azure Honeynet: Simulating Real-World Cyber Attacks
## Introduction
  The purpose of this project is to build a honeynet in Azure to simulate real-world cyber attacks. 
This project will showcase my skills in incident respose, environmental hardening, virtual machine environments, and Azure security

## Objective 
The primary objective for this project was to create an virtual machine environment that is intentionally vulnerable within the Azure infrstructure in order to attract and learn from maliscious attacks in real time. 
  This will help me better understand the tactics and strategies attackers will use, whilst showcasing my ability to respond quickly and effectively to issues that arise.
